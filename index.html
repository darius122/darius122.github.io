            <h2><u>History of Sushi</u></h2>
            <div class = "textbox">
                <p>The history of Sushi began with paddy
                fields, where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was
                discarded. The earliest form of the dish, today referred to as narezushi, was created 
                in Japan around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age). In the Muromachi
                period (1336–1573), people began to eat the rice as well as the fish. During the 
                Edo period (1603–1867), vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. The dish
                has become a form of food strongly associated with Japanese culture. The inventor
                of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type 
                of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared 
                rice, around 1824 in the Edo period. It was the fast food of the chōnin class 
                in the Edo period</p>
